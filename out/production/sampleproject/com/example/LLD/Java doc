Synchronization

Synchronization in java is the ability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource .
In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try to access the shared resources at a time to produce inconsistent results.
The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads.

Runnable

java.lang.Runnable is an interface that is to be implemented by a class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread.
There are two ways to start a new Thread â€“ Subclass Thread and implement Runnable.
There is no need of subclassing a Thread when a task can be done by overriding only run() method of Runnable.
