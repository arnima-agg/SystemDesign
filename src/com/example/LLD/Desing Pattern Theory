Builder Pattern

lets suppose a class has few mandatory and optional fields. lets take car class
mandatory fields - seat, engine, fule tank, steering
optinal - music, airbag

we can define all these fields in 3 ways -:
contructor - need to efine all optional and mandatory which will make extra effort and don't provide clean code
Builder - cood looks clean. immutable obj after it is build. simple construction
create a builder class and build method and define all the methods there

we can use @builder annotation from lambok to create that
setters - we can refine any defined object usign setters. this make obj mutable. but immutable is better
